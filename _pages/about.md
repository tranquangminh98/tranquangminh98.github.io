I currently work at AIOZ Pte Ltd as a research assistant on robot navigation and medical image registration, mentored by [Mr. Tuong Do](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qCcSKkMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Dr. Anh Nguyen](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.nguyen).

I was also an undergrad at VNUHCM-University of Science and graduated from the Honors Program in Information and Technology. At HCMUS, I did undergraduate research on deep reinforcement learning for robot navigation, mentored by [Prof. Ngoc Q. Ly](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MskoD4gAAAAJ&hl=en).
